# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Description
A comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 case data from Our World in Data. This project tracks infection trends, mortality rates, and vaccination progress across countries.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Analyze global pandemic progression
2. Compare country-level responses
3. Visualize key metrics (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
4. Identify patterns in outbreak waves

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas (Data manipulation)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (Analysis environment)

## 📊 How to Run
